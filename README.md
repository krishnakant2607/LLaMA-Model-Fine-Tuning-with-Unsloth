# LLaMA Model Fine-Tuning with Unsloth

This repository provides a streamlined and efficient pipeline for fine-tuning LLaMA-based language models using the [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai) library. It is designed for instruction-tuning tasks with support for QLoRA, PEFT, and Hugging Face datasets.

## Overview

The `finetuning_project_unsloth.py` script enables fine-tuning of pre-trained LLaMA models with a focus on low memory usage and high performance. It incorporates the latest advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning and is well-suited for custom dataset applications such as chatbot instruction tuning or domain-specific model adaptation.

## Key Features

- Fine-tuning using **QLoRA** for memory-efficient training
- Integration with the **Unsloth** framework and Hugging Face ecosystem
- Support for instruction-format datasets with `input` and `output` fields
- Flexible configuration for training parameters, model type, and dataset path
- Compatible with both local GPU setups and cloud environments

## Dependencies

To install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install unsloth datasets trl peft accelerate
```

Ensure that your system meets the hardware requirements for running LLaMA-based models, preferably with a GPU (16GB+ VRAM recommended).

## Dataset Format

The script expects datasets in JSON or Hugging Face-compatible format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "input": "Your prompt here",
  "output": "Expected model response"
}
```

## Usage

Update the model and dataset paths as required in the script, then execute:

```bash
python finetuning_project_unsloth.py
```

This will initiate the fine-tuning process and save the model checkpoint and LoRA adapters upon completion.

## Output

- Fine-tuned model artifacts are saved to the `./model` directory
- LoRA adapter weights are stored for efficient deployment or merging
